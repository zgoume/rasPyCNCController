# Abstract jogger class. In order to implement your own jogger, you need to derive this class.
# when the jogger is initialized, the install method will be called with a widget as a parameter. This can be used to catch Qt events.
# The jogger can have its own thread, it just needs to produce the following events (ALL COORDINATES ARE IN METRIC)
# relative_move_event((x,y,z), feed). If feed is None, a 60 move will be executed, otherwise a G1. x,y,z are the move offsets
# absolute_move_event((x,y,z), feed). If feed is None, a 60 move will be executed. Same as above, but absolute move. good for homing.
# home_update_event((x,y,z)). Sets the current coordinates as (x,y,z). If any of x, y or z are None, that coordinate is unchanged (use (None, None, 0) to set Z=0)
# exit_event(bool). Indicate that we want to exit the jogging. True means "OK" and False means "Cancel"
# error_event(exception). Indicate an error.
#
# start and stop should enable/disable the jogger
#
# Note: move events that are sent while the machine is moving will be discarded. There is no need to avoid firing multiple move events.
# in order to install a jogger, call the method installJogger of the jogwidget.
